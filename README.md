Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
1. Version control tracks code changes and allows collaboration. GitHub is popular because it’s cloud-based, supports teamwork, and integrates with many tools.
Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
2. A. Go to GitHub → Click New Repository
   B. Name it, choose public/private
   C. Add README, .gitignore, license (optional)
   D. Click Create Repository
Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
3. A README explains:
  ✅ What the project does
  ✅ How to install and use it
  ✅ Contribution guidelines
Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
4.  Public vs. Private Repos
    A. Public: Open to all, good for open-source.
    B. Private: Restricted access, better for businesses.
Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
5. First Commit to GitHub
   A. Add changes: git add .
   B. Commit: git commit -m "message"
   C. Push: git push origin main
How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
6. Branching in Git
   A. Branches allow working on features separately.
   B. Create: git branch feature
   C. Switch: git checkout feature
   D. Merge: git merge feature
Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
7. Pull Requests
   A. Used to review & merge changes.
   B. Open PR on GitHub → Get reviewed → Merge.
Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
8.  Forking vs. Cloning
   A. Fork: Copies a repo on GitHub (for contributions).
   B. Clone: Copies a repo locally (for personal work).
Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
 9. Issues & Project Boards
    A. Issues: Track bugs & tasks.
    B. Boards: Organize work (To-Do, In Progress, Done).
Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
10. Best Practices
   ✅ Commit often
   ✅ Use branches
   ✅ Write clear commit messages
   ✅ Review code before merging
   ✅ Use Issues for tracking

     GitHub = Collaboration + Code Management!
